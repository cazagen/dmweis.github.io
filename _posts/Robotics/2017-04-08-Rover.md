# Teaser of an upcoming project

_More info coming in the following weeks_

This project is drew inspiration from [Mars Robot Rover RC Crawler with directional wheels](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1583399) on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/). Except all parts were designed by me without using the original parts.
Models were created using  [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).
All of the designs will be open sourced and publicly available on both [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/) and Github as soon as I feel comfortable with the progress I made so far.

All of the software is alredy available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/dmweis/RoverController)
