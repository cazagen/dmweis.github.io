# First week: Magic book!

Our first week assignment was to create an augmented reading experience using mobile AR. With this simple assignment, we decided to start with the software that we were both previously experienced with. Unity and Vuforia. Unity being the game engine that I have quite a lot of experience with and Vufoira being the gluing piece providing AR functionality to our game.
Let me start by saying that even though I am fairly experienced with Vuforia, using it both at work and in previous projects, I am not entirely a fan. Now don’t get me wrong. Vuforia is great. Performance is better than other competition I used, even though it’s not open source it is free to use for development purposes and it’s also fairly easy to get a very simple game up and running in no time (in most cases). My distaste for Vuforia comes more from some of their decision in the past few months and namely their transition away from using simple planar markers and to using their own VuMarkers that are difficult to make. And Vuforia doesn’t provide any easy to usable samples.
