# This weeks topic is Tracking!

Let me start by saying that tracking is my most favorite topic in VR/AR. And when I started writing this post the first time I wrote 700 words of just introduction. I may try to post it as an alternative version but for now here is a very compressed version!

We also didn't do a project this week. At least not entierly. Insted my mobile VR project is a bit of a combination of trackign and mobile. But let me start from the begining. As I said tracking is my favorite topic. And my most favorite trackin system is the Lighthouse tracking system. It was one of the driving reasons for why I bouhgt a vive for mysel. And I have to say that my vive spends most of it's days just laying on my table and plugged in just to work as a reciever for my controllers. Wiritng a simple program that circumvented the entire VR system and just used to controllers as tracking points was actaully one of the first things I did with my vive. And I have since used it for many things ranging from controlling a robotic arm to copy motion of human hand.

let me explain why I love the light house first. The lighhouse system works on a very simple principle taht is based on the system taht is used to navigate plans for landing. Ironically something I alter become very aquinted with when I started workign for Insero Software and was on a team that wrote an application used for testing of just that system.
The lighuse comsists of one/two base stations that have infrared lgiths in them that regularly flash the entire room with infrared light, and than two motors that to a horizontal and vertical sweep with infrared light. Since I am limited on word count I won't go into detail but here is a nice video taht exaplins it
