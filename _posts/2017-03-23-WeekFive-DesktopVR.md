# This week's topic: Desktop VR

Finally. Desktop VR. A topic very close to my heart. Maybe not my most favorite to talk about (That would be [tracking]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-03-02-WeekThree-Tracking %})) but definitely one of the most favorite ones taht I also have most expirience with. As I previously mentiond I own an [HTC Vive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Vive).
