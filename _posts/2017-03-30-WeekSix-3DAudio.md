# This week's topic: 3D Audio!

We did a small project this week. Nothing complicated just a small Google Daydream game. It has a single scene. You are standing on a pllane in the middle of space with the Obslisk from 21. Space Odyssey in teh middle. And if you look at it and click your controller it will start making noise.

You can teleport around the scene using your daydream controller to expirience spatial audio but it isn't much.

It shows the concept of spatial audio fairly well and doesn't overcomplicate the expirience with any overcomplicated mechanics

Audio ofcourse can be a very interesting topic. It's a surprisingly importatn sense of ours and we probably use it for way more than most of us realize. It's the primary sense that filles your spatial awarness beside your vision. And it's there to tell you what lies beyond your field of view. That's very importatn in VR since we are still workign with fairly limited FOV when it comes to VR. A regular human has FOV of over 180 degrees while both of the current mainstream desktop VR headsets have around 110 degrees. Or less depending of how close can you get the headset to your face.
Another interesting fact about humans is that as with disynchronization of sight and inner VR we also get slighly motion sick if the sound is not synchronized with our vision or inner ear. So if you are in VR and your audio is not spatial you can very easily get motion sick. The feeling will generally not be as strong as it would be if what you see was out of sync but it can still be bad enought to make you sick.

Interestingly enoght audio in the future can be used for a lot more than just... audio.
Samsung is developic a headset known as [](http://www.roadtovr.com/samsungs-new-headphones-trick-your-inner-ear-to-move-you-in-vr/) taht uses [galvanic vestibular stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_vestibular_stimulation) to _"trcik"_ your brain into not getting motion sick.
